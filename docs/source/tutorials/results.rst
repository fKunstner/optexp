This tutorial assumes you have completed the :doc:`quick install </quickinstall>`
and have run some experiments, for example the :doc:`gridsearch tutorial </tutorials/first_gridsearch>`.


Say you have defined experiments in a file ``experiments.py``,
they have all run and are uploaded to wandb (you can which with ``python experiments.py check``),
and now you want to make some customized plots.
